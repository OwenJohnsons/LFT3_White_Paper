The science payload includes a mid-band phased array operating from 300--900 MHz, a wide band and high band antenna (600-1800 MHz), an ``FM'' band antenna (80--110 MHz), and a low band antenna (1--50 MHz). 

The mid-band array covers the bulk of the lander top surface with 48 dual polarizatio wideband antenna elements. The array forms a fan of beams on the sky designed to cover most of the lunar sky over time (Fig.\ \ref{fig:midband_beam_maps}). Formed beam output signals are downconverted and sampled in a  50 MHz subband that is tuned scanned repeatedly across the array operating bandwidth.
